| USER STORIES |
As a parent or educator working with students who have articulation needs, I want to quickly create and reference treatment targets individualized for each student on my caseload in order to reduce my workload and provide evidence-based practice.

| MVP GOALS |
- User login/logout
- create student profiles
- generate a word list between 5-10 words based on the following parameters: target sound, word context (e.g. beginning, middle, end)
- generate word targets given user set parameters using ChatGPT 3.5 API with function calls
- edit student profile (including word list)
- Routes all protected by authorization - user must be logged in to see
- edit user profile

| Stretch Goals |
- allow user to share word lists
- allow user to print word lists
- allow user to track student progress
- allow user to select between real & nonsense words
- allow user to group students
- allow user to create multiple target sounds for each student
- generate word targets embedded in phrases & sentences and/or short story given user set parameters using ChatGPT 3.5 API with function calls
- provide optional phonotactic constraints (e.g. 1-, 2- or 3-syllable words), optional thematic constraints (e.g. Halloween vocabulary) to target words
