"This app is a must for school-based SLPs!! I love that it can create a quick target sound specific word list for me and exclude certain other sounds that are difficult for my student. This will save me loads of time finding specific words for students in a group. The sounds are even grouped type! I canâ€™t wait to use this for 5 min Artic & group sessions with my students!!"
